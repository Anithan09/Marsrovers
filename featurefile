Feature: Rover Direction Facing and Positioning Initialization

  Scenario: Initialize Rover with a specific direction and position
    Given a new Rover
    When I initialize the Rover with direction "N" and position (0, 0)
    Then the Rover's direction should be "N"
    And the Rover's position should be (0, 0)

  Scenario: Initialize Rover with an invalid direction
    Given a new Rover
    When I try to initialize the Rover with an invalid direction "X" and position (2, 3)
    Then the initialization should fail with an error message

  Scenario: Initialize Rover with invalid position
    Given a new Rover
    When I try to initialize the Rover with direction "E" and an invalid position (-1, 5)
    Then the initialization should fail with an error message

  Scenario: Initialize Rover with default direction and position
    Given a new Rover
    When I initialize the Rover without specifying a direction and position
    Then the Rover's direction should be set to the default direction (e.g., "N")
    And the Rover's position should be set to the default position (e.g., (0, 0))

  Scenario: Initialize Rover with custom default direction and position
    Given a new Rover with a custom default direction "W" and position (3, 4)
    When I initialize the Rover without specifying a direction and position
    Then the Rover's direction should be set to the custom default direction "W"
    And the Rover's position should be set to the custom default position (e.g., (3, 4))

Feature: Rover Movement
  Scenario: Move the Rover in different directions
    Given a new Rover at position (0, 0) facing "N"
    When I move the Rover "1" step in direction "N"
    Then the Rover's position should be "(0, 1)" and facing "N"

    Given a new Rover at position (0, 0) facing "E"
    When I move the Rover "2" steps in direction "E"
    Then the Rover's position should be "(2, 0)" and facing "E"

    Given a new Rover at position (3, 3) facing "S"
    When I move the Rover "3" steps in direction "S"
    Then the Rover's position should be "(3, 0)" and facing "S"

    Given a new Rover at position (3, 3) facing "W"
    When I move the Rover "4" steps in direction "W"
    Then the Rover's position should be "(0, 3)" and facing "W"

Feature: Rover Movement

  Scenario: Move the Rover as per the given scenario problem
    Given a new Rover on a 5x5 grid
    And the Rover is at position (1, 2) facing "N"
    When I move the Rover according to the commands "LMLMLMLMM"
    Then the Rover's final position should be "(1, 3)" and facing "N"
